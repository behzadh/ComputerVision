# Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors Project Documentation Guideline

> Rock Paper Scissors Game is a game that asks two users for a hand sign of Rock, Paper or Scissors in the same time and defines a winer based on some conditions. This code has 4 classes: rock paper scissors and nothing.

- To start the design of this game we first need to train computer to recognize what are the rock, paper, scissors and nothing signs. We use this website to train our four classes:
